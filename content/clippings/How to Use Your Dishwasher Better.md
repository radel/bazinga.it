Good news: Your dishwasher should get every dish completely clean, almost every time you run it—without your prerinsing the dishes before you load them.

Even if your dishwasher is a low performer, you can probably get it to work well if you make a few tweaks to your routine. Here’s how to make the most of it.

## Don’t bother prerinsing. Seriously!

In a 2021 [study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (PDF)](https://eta-publications.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/osg_lbnl_report_dishwashers_final_4.pdf), over half of the respondents reported that they rinsed their dishes before loading them into the dishwasher. Despite what you may have been told in the past, prerinsing is not necessary. Modern dishwashers have never been better at removing grime. This, coupled with enzymatic detergents, which are designed to attack soils, all but ensures a thorough clean. (Remember to be realistic, though: Philip Voglewede, a mechanical engineering professor at Marquette University who formerly worked in the dishwasher division of Whirlpool Corporation, emphasized that if a food is challenging to wash off by hand, you can expect your dishwasher to be challenged, too.)

Every dishwasher company, detergent company, and independent expert we’ve talked to says that prerinsing is unnecessary—as does the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.energystar.gov/products/appliances/dishwashers/best_practices). Some of our sources even said that you might get better results without prerinsing because [modern enzymatic detergents work better](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-dishwasher-detergent/#who-this-is-for) when they can cling to food. When you skip the prerinse, you’ll also [save a bunch of water, energy](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-dishwasher/#how-we-picked-and-tested), and effort. (There are many stubborn holdouts, but we’ve seen skeptics morph into believers after skipping the prerinse once. Why not give it a go?)

We’ve also confirmed this conclusion with our own tests, over and over and over again. In [one round of testing](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/how-wirecutter-tests-dishwashers/), we ran 12 different dishwashers loaded with some of the crustiest, most stubborn food stains. With zero prerinsing on our part, they almost always did a great job. We repeated the tests a handful of times for each model and got the same results. We did encounter a couple of exceptions: Some models struggled when we used discount, store-brand detergent, but they did better when we tried a stronger, brand-name formula. So if you think your dishwasher doesn’t work without prerinsing, try a different detergent (see below) or find out whether a bit of maintenance helps (also see below).

Worried that all the food remnants will clog the dishwasher and eventually ruin it? That won’t happen: Modern dishwashers have [filters](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-dishwasher/#how-we-picked-and-tested) to catch any chunks of food that would be big enough to jam the system. Though the food sits in the filter, it gets worn down by the combination of the enzymes in the detergent and water pressure. Eventually it’s pulverized into tiny bits that can pass through the filter’s tight mesh to be pumped out the drain. You’ll need to [clean the filter periodically](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/why-you-should-clean-your-dishwasher-filter/), and it’s a good idea to scrape off foods like leafy greens, corn, beans, and hunks of meat, which dissolve very slowly.

## Experiment with detergents and use a rinse aid

First, make sure that your detergent has enzymes, which are the key ingredients in modern detergents. As of mid-2023, all of the widely available powders, tabs, and pods we’ve seen contain enzymes, as do most gels. As long as you see protease, amylase, subtilisin, or just generic “enzymes” listed in the ingredients, you’re in business.

Every dishwasher company recommends using a rinse aid, which is a liquid that goes into the hatch next to the main detergent tray. ([Jet-Dry](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/44134/170299/4/133790/?merchant=Amazon) is a popular one, but you can find many others.) During the final-rinse portion of a cycle, the dishwasher squirts a few milliliters of this stuff into the tub, where it reduces or prevents chalky water spots and hazy films from remaining on your dishes. It also helps dishes, especially plastic items, dry more completely. Over the years, our sources have reiterated that using a rinse aid can significantly improve the performance of your dishwasher. It’s a step worth remembering.

If you have hard water and no softening system, you’ll probably need to use a higher-end detergent that contains additives aimed at improving hard-water performance. You can find this information on a detergent’s label.

More detergent is not always better. High-end formulas like [Finish Quantum Powerball](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/56242/191264/4/163880/?merchant=Walmart) are formulated to work in the most challenging conditions, such as hard water and quick-wash cycles. They might be overkill for some people—or even actively detrimental to dish care. If you can smell or see or taste residue, that could be a sign that you’re overdoing it with detergent. Ditto if you notice your glassware starting to etch over time.

Another tweak to consider is switching to a stronger cycle. An “auto/sensor” or “heavy/pots and pans” cycle will work harder to clean your dishes than “normal.”

This convenient pod did the best job of annihilating tough messes, and it neutralizes odors with a mild lemon scent. But it doesn’t leave glassware as shiny as some other detergents.

## Load it well (and with the right things)

Correct loading means different things for different dishwashers (when in doubt, read the manual for tips on the best loading schemes), but here are some near-universal tips.

Aim the dirtiest surfaces down, toward the wash arms. This seems obvious, but we’ve seen dishwashers loaded with upside-down bowls and sideways cups, so there’s some value in saying it. Not only are haphazardly loaded dishes incompletely washed, but items like bowls and ladles could end up filled with dirty water. (The good news: You can stack bowls a little tighter than you might think. As long as water can flow through the gap, it should be okay.)

In a standard silverware basket, forks and spoons should have their business ends up, so they’re less likely to nest with each other. Knives should point down, so you’re less likely to stab yourself. Items like wooden spoons, wood-handled spatulas, or any utensils not labeled dishwasher safe should not go in the dishwasher. Running them through the machine can damage them and your appliance. (A filter can handle food—don’t test it with splinters.)

Try not to load super-crusty dishes in the corners of the upper racks, because that’s where the cleaning action is weakest.

When you’re loading big pots or pans (that you have double-checked are dishwasher safe) or trays or pitchers on the bottom rack, make sure that they don’t block the path of the upper spray arm.

If you need more help, [Bosch](https://www.bosch-home.in/experience-bosch/living-with-bosch/fresh-reads/how-to-load-your-bosch-dishwasher-the-right-way) and [Whirlpool](https://www.whirlpool.com/blog/kitchen/proper-way-to-load-a-dishwasher.html) both have some helpful loading tips that apply to most brands’ dishwashers.

## Don’t forget the maintenance

Clean your machine at least a few times per year. We cover the details in our article about [how to clean your dishwasher](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/how-to-clean-your-dishwasher/), but the short version is this: Whenever you sniff a lingering odor, spot some mineral-scale buildup, or notice a drop in cleaning performance, start by cleaning the filter. If that doesn’t work, run a self-cleaning cycle with some kind of acidic cleaner or a product designed specifically for dishwasher cleaning. If your dishwasher continues to smell, [clean the seal and other superficial parts](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/how-to-clean-dishwasher-of-mold/). Bacteria, fungus, mold, and mildew grow in dark places, and the corners and seal of a dishwasher are no exceptions.

If those first steps don’t fix your performance problems, or your dishwasher throws up an error code, you can try to do some troubleshooting. We recommend checking out [Repair Clinic](https://www.repairclinic.com/RepairHelp/Dishwasher-Repair-Help) or any similar DIY-repair resource for checklists and video tutorials to help you diagnose the problem. Start with [this basic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APdhKLyr7s4). There’s a good chance you’ll be able to resolve the problem on your own—or at least get an idea of what’s wrong before you call for service.

    Bosch dishwashers do it a little differently—and, we’d argue, more elegantly—than other dishwasher brands.
