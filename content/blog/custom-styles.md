2022 was the year when I rediscovered my passion for photography. It hadn't really gone away, but I had reached a kind of plateau: I wasn't growing, I wasn't improving, and my photos were all very similar.

I also lacked imagination. I would spend hours at my computer editing my photos, following the advice of many great photographers on YouTube, but the results were disappointing.
So I tried to get back to the heart of it all: wouldn't it be beautiful to take the camera, mount a lens, and shoot without worrying about anything?

The first push came from the lens itself: the Fujinon XF 23mm f2. In 2022, I practically never took it off my XT-20, and I still don't see anything that can replace it. This focal length gave me the right perspective, a way to show everyone what I saw. Mounted on my camera, it was discreet, simple, easy.
My process wasn't complete yet. Now that shooting had a new flavor, I wanted it to really have taste. And like a lightning bolt, I stumbled upon this discovery on Fuji Weekly.

I discovered that users of the Fujifilm X-series can load combinations of settings into their cameras (up to 7 different combinations) that allow shooting in a variety of styles. The settings include a choice of built-in film simulation mode, white balance, and adjustments to the tone curve (shadows and highlights), sharpness, and saturation. These saved setting combinations are known as recipes.

BOOM. No more hours spent editing (poorly) hundreds of photos, but finally a simple and linear process: Shoot, export the photos, share them. At most, I adjust the exposure a bit and straighten the photo, but the vast majority of the photos (and all those you see on this site) are Jpegs straight out of my camera (SOOC = Straight Out Of Camera).

Over time, I've tried many different recipes, but I keep coming back to the same ones. 
Here are my favorites from 2022.
